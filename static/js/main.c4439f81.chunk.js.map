I've had the privilege of working in a uniquely challenging space alongside incredibly talented\n      colleagues and modern technologies. As part of a small but impactful team of frontend engineers, I help maintain\n      Flashpoint's core platform and contribute to the evolution of our cross-product <b>React</b> codebase.<br /><br />\n      \n      My work centers on building intuitive, reliable, and scalable user experiences. I manage and maintain our shared\n      <b>React component library</b>, ensuring consistency with our <b>Design System</b> across multiple products. I've led efforts\n      to design and implement complex interfaces such as our Investigation AI Workspace, which supports user chat,\n      suggested prompts, and custom report generation. I also collaborate across the organization to strengthen platform\n      usability i.e. improving performance, refining UI patterns, and making data more accessible for our users.<br /><br />\n\n      Beyond feature development, I take an active role in shaping engineering practices and product direction. This includes\n      partnering closely with Product and Design on requirements and technical documentation, driving end-to-end delivery\n      from development through <b>Cypress testing</b> and production deployment, and establishing frontend standards informed by user-behavior\n      metrics. I regularly present new functionality to engineering and product teams, assist teammates through code review and agile\n      ceremonies, and serve on an AI Governance working group to help identify safe, effective AI tooling and workflow enhancements.<br /><br />\n\n      While my primary focus is frontend engineering, I also contribute backend support when needed, building <b>RESTful APIs</b> with <b>Python</b>,\n      <b>Flask</b>, and <b>Node.js</b>. For one such project, I developed an internal API wrapper for the Looker API in Python, enabling us to surface Looker\n      maintained data directly within our platform using our own Design System and React component library. This allows us to deliver\n      a consistent, unified user interface while preserving the full functionality and insight users expect from Looker dashboards.\n      Across all of these efforts, my goal remains the same: to create thoughtful, reliable interfaces and tools that help users work\n      more efficiently in a high-stakes environment.<br /><br />`,\n    links: [{ href: \"https://flashpoint.io\", label: \"Flashpoint\" }],\n  },\n  {\n    company: \"Booksmart Touring / Daysheets\",\n    date: \"June 2014 - July 2020\",\n    title: \"Co-founder/Lead UI Engineer/Advisor\",\n    description: `I co-founded a company with two friends based around helping manage the hectic life on the road of\n      touring musicians.
