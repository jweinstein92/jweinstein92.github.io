      navigation and search experience, display ingested media from chat rooms with various filters for actionable responses,
      redesigning analytics dashboards to be more digestible and appealing, and providing simple interfaces to test
      various API integrations for their systems. I have touched every aspect of the platform, work with
      multiple teams, handle the collection of user metrics, triage issues, lead aspects of our agile development cycle,
